Assignment 0 - Mesh Viewer - Dianne Cao
=====================================
To compile and run the code once I was in the folder
1. Run: cmake ..
2. Run: make
3. Run: ./assignment0 // for the render to pop up

Initially, I didn't realize that I needed to recompile the code every time I made changes
I spent about 1 hour debugging this issue during office hours before realizing I was missing the compile step.

COLLABORATION
-------------
I discussed the assignment with people around me during review sessions, but there was
no official collaboration.

RESOURCE
----------
- GitHub Copilot: Used to explain code structure and concepts and debug during office hour
- Course materials and lecture notes
- GLFW documentation for key codes
- GLOO framework documentation

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------
N/A The code is working and I have completed nessasery steps.

EXTRA CREDIT
------------
I implemented an additional feature: a toggle on and off for the directional light using the 'P' key.


FEEDBACK
-------------------
The assignment was super fun! I wish there had been more
explanation of the code structure at the beginning. Since this material wasn't directly
related to the lectures, it was overwhelming initially to navigate through the codebase
and understand how all the components fit together.
